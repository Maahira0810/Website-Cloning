# Website Cloning  

A **pixel-perfect clone of a makeup website** — built to practice and explore web development skills.  

## 🌸 Features  
- 🎨 Replicates the original site’s design & layout  
- 🖥️ Fully responsive structure  
- 🛍️ Sections for products, categories, and promotions  
- ⚡ Clean & structured HTML/CSS  

## 🚀 Tech Used  
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript**  

## 📌 Why This Project?  
To sharpen my **frontend skills** by cloning real-world websites. This helps me learn how designs flow, how layouts scale, and how interactivity is built from scratch.  

## 🔮 What’s Next?  
- Add more interactivity (hover effects, animations)  
- Maybe build multiple clones of different types of websites (fashion, tech, lifestyle)
